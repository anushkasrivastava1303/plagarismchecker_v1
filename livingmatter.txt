Living things are things that exhibit characteristics including response, growth, metabolism, energy conversion, and reproduction. The word "life" is a noun, just like other specified entities, yet it might be better expressed as a verb to represent its fundamental nature as a process. Individuals, or living things that may be classified into groups (taxa), make up life. Each person is made up of one or more cells, which are the smallest living entities. Cells have the ability to grow, reproduce, and change other chemicals into carbon-based ones through metabolism. The development of genetic variety and natural selection led to the evolution of the life forms that are present on Earth today from their ancient common ancestors. Despite the claim made in some research that life may have started as early as 4.1 billion years ago,The properties of living creatures include reaction, expansion, metabolism, energy conversion, and reproduction. Like other defined concepts, "life" is a noun, although it would be better stated as a verb to reflect that it is fundamentally a process. Life is made up of individuals or living objects that can be categorised into groupings (taxa). The tiniest living things, called cells, make up every single human being. The ability of cells to multiply, develop, and convert non-carbon-based molecules into carbon-based ones is known as metabolism. The evolution of the living forms that are extant on Earth today from their prehistoric common ancestors was facilitated by the emergence of genetic diversity and natural selection. Despite the assertion that certain studies suggest life could have begun as early as 4.1 billion years ago.

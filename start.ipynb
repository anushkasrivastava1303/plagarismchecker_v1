       "['Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. As of 2022, 2.16 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates. It has been estimated there are around 7.77 million animal species. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.\\n\\nMost living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes, containing animals such as nematodes, arthropods, flatworms, annelids and molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.',\n",
       " '  living matter and, as such, matter that shows certain attributes that include responsiveness, growth, metabolism, energy transformation, and reproduction. Although a noun, as with other defined entities, the word life might be better cast as a verb to reflect its essential status as a process. Life comprises individuals, living beings, assignable to groups (taxa). Each individual is composed of one or more minimal living units, called cells, and is capable of transformation of carbon-based and other compounds (metabolism), growth, and participation in reproductive acts. Life-forms present on Earth today have evolved from ancient common ancestors through the generation of hereditary variation and natural selection. Although some studies state that life may have begun as early as 4.1 billion years ago, it can be traced to fossils dated to 3.5–3.7 billion years ago, which is still only slightly younger than Earth, which gravitationally accreted into a planet about 4.5 billion years ago. But this is life as a whole. More than 99.9 percent of species that have ever lived are extinct. The several branches of science that reveal the common historical, functional, and chemical basis of the evolution of all life include electron microscopy, genetics, paleobiology (including paleontology), and molecular biology.The phenomenon of life can be approached in several ways: life as it is known and studied on planet Earth; life imaginable in principle; and life, by hypothesis, that might exist elsewhere in the universe (see extraterrestrial life). As far as is known, life exists only on Earth. Most life-forms reside in a thin sphere that extends about 23 km (14 miles) from 3 km (2 miles) beneath the bottom of the ocean to the top of the troposphere (lower atmosphere); the relative thickness is comparable to a coat of paint on a rubber ball. An estimated 10–30 million distinguishable species currently inhabit this sphere of life, or biosphere.',\n",
       " 'Living things are things that exhibit characteristics including response, growth, metabolism, energy conversion, and reproduction. The word \"life\" is a noun, just like other specified entities, yet it might be better expressed as a verb to represent its fundamental nature as a process. Individuals, or living things that may be classified into groups (taxa), make up life. Each person is made up of one or more cells, which are the smallest living entities. Cells have the ability to grow, reproduce, and change other chemicals into carbon-based ones through metabolism. The development of genetic variety and natural selection led to the evolution of the life forms that are present on Earth today from their ancient common ancestors. Despite the claim made in some research that life may have started as early as 4.1 billion years ago,The properties of living creatures include reaction, expansion, metabolism, energy conversion, and reproduction. Like other defined concepts, \"life\" is a noun, although it would be better stated as a verb to reflect that it is fundamentally a process. Life is made up of individuals or living objects that can be categorised into groupings (taxa). The tiniest living things, called cells, make up every single human being. The ability of cells to multiply, develop, and convert non-carbon-based molecules into carbon-based ones is known as metabolism. The evolution of the living forms that are extant on Earth today from their prehistoric common ancestors was facilitated by the emergence of genetic diversity and natural selection. Despite the assertion that certain studies suggest life could have begun as early as 4.1 billion years ago',\n",

living matter and as such matter that has certain properties,including reactivity, growth, metabolism, energy conversion and reproduction. Although it is a noun like other defined entities, the word life might be better expressed as a verb to reflect its essential status as a process. Life consists of individuals, living beings that can be assigned to groups (taxa). Each individual consists of one or more minimal living units called cells and is capable of converting carbon-based and other compounds (metabolism), growing and reproducing. The life forms found on Earth today evolved from ancient common ancestors through the creation of heritable variations and natural selection.Although some studies claim that life may have begun 4.1 billion years ago, it can be traced back to fossils from 3.5 to 3.7 billion years ago, which is still only slightly younger than Earth, which accumulated by gravity until it became a planet about 4.5 billion years ago. years before.But that's life as a whole. More than 99.9 percent of the species that ever existed are extinct. The various branches of science that reveal the common historical, functional, and chemical basis of the evolution of all life include electron microscopy, genetics, paleobiology (including paleontology), and molecular biology. The phenomenon of life can be approached in different ways: as it is known and studied on planet Earth; imaginable life in principle; and life, hypothesized to exist in other parts of the universe (see extraterrestrial life).As far as is known, life only exists on Earth. Most life forms live in a thin sphere that extends about 23 km (14 miles) from 3 km (2 miles) below the ocean floor to the top of the troposphere (lower atmosphere); The relative thickness is comparable to a layer of paint on a rubber ball. It is estimated that between 10 and 30 million distinct species currently live in this area of ​​life or biosphere.
